# Introduction to React
This is not an original project but rather a project from the Udemy course "React - The Complete Guide". Thus, all credit goes to Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, the instructor for the course. 

  The course can be found [HERE](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/?LSNPUBID=yFouE4wh9Xg&ranEAID=yFouE4wh9Xg&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=yFouE4wh9Xg-z8XhG3dueHzD6RfmYWDqOA&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_source=aff-campaign)






  The project contains Java Script, CSS, and HTML and requires the installation of NodeJS to work properly since the project utilizes a React framework.
  Additionally, all dependencies have already been downloaded as of the initial commit.

  Use 'npm start' to run the enviornment
